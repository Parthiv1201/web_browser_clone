i want to tell u i miss u with no subtext.
No guilt , no anger , no expectations that you'll fix it. 
i don't want u to feel bad or tell me it will get better 
this is where we r meant to be right now me apart from u 
my hands a little empty nd my heart a little sad.
i just miss u.
i wanted u to know.
